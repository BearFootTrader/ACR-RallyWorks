## Fix: Resolved missing Damper/Suspension values on Gravel & Snow surfaces

## 🐛 The Bug
When selecting **Gravel** or **Snow** as the surface type, the **Dampers (Slow/Fast Bump & Rebound)** section was disappearing from the output results.

### Root Cause
The script performed mathematical calculations on the base setup values (Integers) using decimal multipliers (e.g., `* 0.6`).
* **PowerShell behavior:** Multiplying an `Int` by a decimal automatically converts the result to a `Double` (floating-point number).
* **The error:** The output rendering logic contained a strict type check: `if ($val -is [int])`. Because the calculated values were now `Double`, this check failed, and the script skipped printing the data.

## 🛠️ The Fix
I have refactored the `Calculate-All-Setup` function to handle data types more robustly.

### Key Changes:
1.  **Implemented `IsNumeric` Helper Function**
    Added a helper to validate numbers regardless of whether they are `Int`, `Double`, or `Decimal`.
    ```powershell
    function IsNumeric ($val) {
        return ($val -is [int] -or $val -is [double] -or $val -is [decimal])
    }
    ```

2.  **Explicit Integer Casting**
    Applied `[int][math]::Round(...)` to all suspension calculations. This ensures that calculated spring rates and damper settings remain clean Integers, which is preferred for configuration files.
    ```powershell
    # Before
    $currentSetup.SpringRateF = $currentSetup.SpringRateF * 0.65

    # After
    $currentSetup.SpringRateF = [int][math]::Round($currentSetup.SpringRateF * 0.65)
    ```

3.  **Removed Strict Output Restrictions**
    Updated the UI rendering logic to display damper values as long as they exist, removing the buggy `if -is [int]` constraint.

## ✅ Verification
* **Test:** Select "Gravel" or "Snow" surface with any Car Class.
* **Result:** The "Dampers" section now correctly appears in the "Engineering Setup Results" panel with adjusted values.

### 🏎️ Core Physics Engine
- **ACR Data Implementation:** Logic rewritten based on real telemetry extracted from the *Lancia Delta Integrale* setup file.
- **Asymmetric Suspension:** Implemented "Stiff Front / Soft Rear" spring rate logic (e.g., `70kN` front / `50kN` rear) to match specific ACR chassis behavior.
- **Damping Ratios:** Updated Damper logic to reflect the specific ACR standard where *Slow Rebound* is approx. **60% higher** than *Slow Bump*.

### ⚙️ Drivetrain & Braking
- **Differential Ramps:** Replaced generic angles with ACR-specific ramp logic (e.g., `60°` Accel / `75°` Coast) to optimize corner entry.
- **Braking Bias:** Shifted baseline bias forward to `~65%` to match the simulator's braking physics.

### 🔄 System & Scalability
- **Dynamic Weather Scaling:** Replaced static values with mathematical modifiers (e.g., `-50%` ARB stiffness for *Heavy Rain*), ensuring correct wet/snow setups for **all** car classes.
- **Universal Compatibility:** Scaled the *Group A* physics logic to correctly calculate setups for *WRC*, *R5*, and *Historic* classes.

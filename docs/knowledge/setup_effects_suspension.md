# Setup Effects - Suspension

## Springs
- Stiffer front springs reduce front grip on rough surfaces and increase understeer.
- Stiffer rear springs increase rotation but can reduce traction on exit.
- Softer springs improve compliance but can feel lazy in quick direction changes.
- Stiffer overall rates flatten the car and sharpen response on smooth or high-speed stages; softer rates keep tyres planted on bumpy or rutted gravel.
- On very rough gravel stages a “semi-soft” approach (DirtFish) works: softer than tarmac, but not so soft that the car bottoms out. Raise ride height first, then soften springs until impacts are controlled.

## Anti-Roll Bars (ARBs)
- Stiffer front ARB increases understeer and supports turn-in on smooth tarmac.
- Stiffer rear ARB increases oversteer and helps rotation in tight corners.
- Softer ARBs improve grip on uneven surfaces but reduce response.

## Ride Height and Rake
- Higher ride height improves clearance and reduces bottoming on gravel.
- Lower ride height improves aero stability and response on smooth tarmac; too low risks floor strikes and instability.
- More rake (rear higher than front) sharpens turn-in but can reduce traction.
- Less rake (rear lower) improves traction but can reduce rotation.
- Aero-sensitive cars: use as low as the stage allows for downforce, then raise until you stop scraping on crests/landings.
- Rough gravel baselines (DR2 community): ride height often at or near max, stiff-ish springs with soft fast bump to avoid floor strikes; tarmac baselines: ride height at minimum with stiffer springs/ARBs.

## Caster and Steering Geometry
- More positive caster improves straight-line stability and self-centering but can add steering weight.
- Less caster lightens steering and can quicken response but may reduce stability at speed.
- Toe-out on turns (Ackermann) helps inside wheels turn tighter and reduce entry understeer; too much increases tyre scrub and heat.

## Alignment Quick Hits
- Front toe-out increases turn-in; front toe-in increases stability. Rear toe-in adds stability; a touch of rear toe-out/less toe-in increases rotation mid-corner.
- Front negative camber boosts cornering grip but costs braking/traction; rear negative camber helps rotation but hurts straight-line drive if excessive.
- Rally alignment tends to stay moderate on gravel (durability, changing grip); tarmac allows more aggressive camber/toe for response.

# Setup Effects - Dampers

## Slow Bump and Slow Rebound
- Slow bump controls weight transfer into corners and under braking.
- Slow rebound controls how quickly the car returns after a load change.
- Too much slow damping reduces grip on mixed surfaces.

## Fast Bump and Fast Rebound
- Fast bump controls response to sharp impacts like ruts and landings.
- Fast rebound controls how the wheel returns after a big hit.
- Too much fast damping causes the car to skip over bumps.

## Directional Tuning
- More front slow bump adds stability under braking but can increase understeer.
- More rear slow rebound can improve traction on exit but reduce rotation.
- Softer fast bump improves compliance and grip on rough gravel.
- Firmer overall damping keeps the platform flat on smooth/high-speed stages; softer damping lets the wheels follow rough terrain and maintain contact.
- Fast bump/rebound thresholds decide when “fast” circuits engage (big hits or very quick compression/extension). Mid thresholds are a safe start; lower thresholds make fast circuits engage more often.
- Practical gravel baseline (DR2 community): slow bump around soft/medium, fast bump at soft, rebound on the firm side to control spring kick; adjust softer rebound if the car skips over bumps.

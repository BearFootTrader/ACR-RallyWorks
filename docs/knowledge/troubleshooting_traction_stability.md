# Troubleshooting - Traction and Stability

## Wheelspin on Exit
- Increase diff preload or use lower ramp angles.
- Soften rear dampers to improve compliance.
- Lower rear tyre pressures slightly.
- Gravel: keep centre/rear diffs on the open side; shorten gearing; drop rear pressures slightly for bite.
- Tarmac: add a bit more rear lock/preload; raise pressures if overheating; ensure ride height is low enough for support.

## Car Feels Nervous at Speed
- Increase rear toe-in or soften rear ARB.
- Reduce fast rebound damping.
- Increase front brake bias slightly.
- Gravel: soften fast rebound and ARB to keep tyres down; add small rear toe-in; keep diff locking modest.
- Tarmac: tighten ARBs/springs a click for precision; add rear toe-in; ensure front aero/ride height isn’t too low to scrape.

## Bottoming or Harsh Landings
- Increase ride height.
- Soften fast bump damping.
- Reduce spring rate slightly.
- Gravel: raise ride height and soften fast bump first; keep springs semi-soft; avoid very stiff ARBs.
- Tarmac: check you’re not overly low for bumps; if so, raise slightly and use firmer springs/ARB to keep platform flat.

## Braking Instability
- Increase front brake bias.
- Reduce rear ARB or rear spring rate.
- Increase front slow bump damping.
- Gravel: keep bias forward and diffs open on coast; soften rear dampers/ARB to stop rear dance.
- Tarmac: add front bias but avoid locking; increase front damper support; ensure rear toe-in is present for straight-line stability.

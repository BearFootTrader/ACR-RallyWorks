# Setup Effects - Gearing

## Gear Set Selection
- Shorter gearing improves acceleration and punch out of slow corners.
- Longer gearing improves top speed and reduces shift frequency.
- Choose ratios that keep the engine in the strongest part of the power band.
- Twistier layouts (e.g., Zandvoort-style or rally hairpins) reward shorter gears; long straight layouts (Monza-style) reward longer gears.

## Practical Directions
- Tight, technical stages prefer shorter gears.
- Fast, flowing stages prefer longer gears.
- If you hit the limiter on long straights, pick a longer set.
- If the car bogs out of hairpins, pick a shorter set.
- Use final drive for coarse top-speed change, then fine-tune 3rd/4th for the key corner exits you care about most.
- Gear spacing rules of thumb (DR2 community):
  - Modern 6-speeds: gap 1–5 around 0.110–0.135, 6th as overdrive with a larger gap (0.180–0.210).
  - 5-speeds: gap 1–4 around 0.130–0.170; 5th as overdrive (0.200–0.280 above 4th).
  - 4-speeds: even gaps around 0.165–0.220.
  - Final drive: run as short as conditions allow; lengthen only if you repeatedly hit limiter on the fastest section.

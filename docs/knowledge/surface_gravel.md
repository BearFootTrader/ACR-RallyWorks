# Surface Guide - Gravel

## Targets
- Maximize compliance and traction.
- Allow some rotation without snap oversteer.

## Typical Directions
- Higher ride height to clear ruts and crests.
- Softer springs and ARBs for grip on loose surfaces.
- Softer fast bump and rebound for impacts.
- More open diffs and lower preload to help rotation.
- Slightly lower tyre pressures for contact patch.
- Geometry baseline (Suspension Secrets WRC loose-gravel): camber front -1.5 to -3.0 deg, rear -1.0 to -2.0 deg; toe front 0 to 2 mm out, rear 1 to 3 mm in; caster around +6 deg.
- Watch tyre temps when lowering pressures—keep them in a stable window over a full stage.
- DirtFish guidance: “semi-soft” suspension with higher ride height; aggressive alignment is rarely helpful because impacts will knock it out—keep camber/toe modest for stability.
- Gearing: shorter final drive and tighter gaps to prioritize acceleration; only lengthen if you constantly hit the limiter on the fastest section.
- Drivetrain: bias torque slightly rearward; keep centre diff on the loose side for rotation unless grip is extremely low (ice/snow), where more lock helps.
- Parts and reliability matter on gravel—protect the car (strong wheels, skid plates) so the setup stays consistent.

## Signs You Went Too Far
- Excessive body roll and slow response.
- Bottoming on big compressions.
- Wheelspin or inside-wheel lift on exits.

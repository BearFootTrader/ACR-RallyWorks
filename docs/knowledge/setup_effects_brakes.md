# Setup Effects - Brakes

## Brake Bias
- More front bias improves stability under braking but increases understeer.
- More rear bias improves rotation but risks rear lockup.
- Start from a balanced split; add front bias for straight-line stability, add rear bias for tighter rotation on entry.
- Simple baseline: 50/50 for a neutral feel; 60–70% front for stability on loose surfaces or if the rear dances under braking.

## Proportioning Valve Pressure
- Higher pressure increases overall braking force.
- Lower pressure helps avoid lockups on loose surfaces.

## Handbrake Multiplier
- Higher multiplier tightens hairpin rotation but can stall the car.
- Lower multiplier keeps stability but needs more steering angle.

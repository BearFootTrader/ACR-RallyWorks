# Surface Guide - Wet or Mixed Grip

## Targets
- Smooth weight transfer and predictable traction.

## Typical Directions
- Slightly softer springs and ARBs than dry tarmac.
- Reduce diff preload and increase ramp angles for flexibility.
- Lower brake pressure and more front bias to prevent rear lock.
- Reduce camber and toe for stability.
- Avoid very low ride heights if standing water is present.

## Signs You Went Too Far
- Excessive understeer from too soft a front end.
- Frequent wheelspin on short straights.
- Long braking distances from low brake pressure.

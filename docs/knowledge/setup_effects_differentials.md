# Setup Effects - Differentials

## Ramp Angles
- Lower ramp angles lock the diff more aggressively.
- Higher ramp angles allow more differentiation.
- Power ramp affects traction on throttle; coast ramp affects turn-in and stability off throttle.
- Higher power locking calms the car on throttle but can push wide; lower power locking rotates better but can oversteer on exit.
- Higher coast locking steadies braking/entry; lower coast locking frees rotation but can feel loose.

## Preload
- Higher preload increases stability and reduces sudden rotation.
- Lower preload improves turn-in and rotation but can feel nervous.

## Plates
- More plates increase locking effect across the range.
- Fewer plates allow smoother slip and better rotation.

## Practical Directions
- Gravel often prefers lower preload and higher ramp angles for rotation.
- Tarmac often prefers more preload and lower ramp angles for stability and traction.
- If the car spins the inside wheel on exit, increase locking or preload.
- If the car refuses to rotate on entry, reduce coast locking.
- Tyre life: if a driven tyre overheats, reduce locking or preload; if it spins excessively, add locking or preload.
- Adjust in small steps and re-test; tiny changes in locking can flip balance from understeer to oversteer.
- Torque split (AWD): bias slightly rearward (e.g., 55–70% rear) for traction and rotation; avoid heavy front bias to reduce understeer.
- Centre diff: medium lock is a safe default; open it for rotation on loose gravel, add lock on ice/snow to keep the car planted.
- Front diff: keep power/coast locking moderate to avoid push; avoid very high power lock on gravel.
- Example gravel baseline (DR2 community): centre diff toward loose; rear driving lock just above open; rear braking lock just below locked; rear preload around 80 Nm. Increase centre lock on very low grip ice/snow to prevent excessive inside-wheel spin.

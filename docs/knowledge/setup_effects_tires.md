# Setup Effects - Tyres

## Pressure
- Higher pressure reduces rolling resistance but lowers compliance and grip.
- Lower pressure improves grip on rough surfaces but increases heat and drag.
- Monitor carcass temps: lower pressures can overheat on long runs; higher pressures can cool but reduce contact patch.

## Camber
- More negative camber increases cornering grip but reduces straight-line traction.
- Less negative camber improves braking and traction on loose surfaces.
- Positive camber can be used sparingly on the outside-heavy side of a stage with dominant same-direction corners to even tyre wear.

## Toe
- Front toe-out improves turn-in but reduces stability.
- Front toe-in improves stability but can dull response.
- Rear toe-in improves stability on exit.
- Rear toe-out increases rotation but can be twitchy.

## Reference Gravel Geometry (Suspension Secrets WRC base)
- Camber: front -1.5 to -3.0 deg; rear -1.0 to -2.0 deg.
- Toe: front 0 to 2 mm out; rear 1 to 3 mm in.

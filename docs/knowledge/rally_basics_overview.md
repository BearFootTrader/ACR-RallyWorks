# Rally Basics Overview

## Goal
Build a setup that gives the driver confidence over mixed surfaces, uneven grip, and large weight transfers. A fast rally setup prioritizes stability, traction, and predictable rotation more than peak cornering grip.

## Core Principles
- Keep the car compliant over bumps. Excess stiffness kills grip on rough surfaces.
- Use balance to control rotation. Front vs rear changes decide understeer or oversteer.
- Preserve traction under throttle. Differentials and tyres do most of the work.
- Avoid extremes. Small changes are easier to read and repeat.
- Bias weight and grip to what the stage needs. Use cross/side weight to favor the dominant corner direction when it helps confidence.
- Tyre pressures and temps are your first safety check: lower for grip/compliance, higher for support and speed—watch temps to avoid overheating.
- Aerodynamics (if adjustable) are a balance of downforce vs top speed: more wing for grip and stability, less for straights.

## Setup Order
1. Tyres and ride height for basic grip and clearance.
2. Springs and ARBs for balance and platform control.
3. Dampers for weight transfer and bump handling.
4. Differentials for traction and corner-exit behavior.
5. Brakes and bias for turn-in and stability.
6. Gearing for stage length and power band usage.

## Track Notes
- Rough and slow stages want softer, taller, and more open diffs.
- Smooth and fast stages want stiffer, lower, and more locked diffs.
- Tune for the worst section first, then refine for overall pace.
- Weight distribution can be stage-biased (e.g., more weight to the side with more frequent corners) but keep predictability as the priority.

## Reference Gravel Geometry (Suspension Secrets WRC base)
- Camber: front -1.5 to -3.0 deg; rear -1.0 to -2.0 deg.
- Caster: +6 deg front.
- Toe: front 0 to 2 mm out; rear 1 to 3 mm in.

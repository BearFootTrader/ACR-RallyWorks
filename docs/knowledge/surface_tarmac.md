# Surface Guide - Tarmac

## Targets
- Maximize precision and stability under high grip.
- Maintain a flat platform for fast transitions.

## Typical Directions
- Lower ride height and reduced rake.
- Stiffer springs and ARBs for response.
- Higher slow damping to control weight transfer.
- More diff locking for traction on power.
- Higher tyre pressures to support the carcass.
- Alignment can be more aggressive than gravel: add negative camber and a touch of front toe-out for sharper response (within tyre temp limits).
- Gear toward top speed only if needed; otherwise keep slightly shorter ratios for punch out of slow chicanes.

## Signs You Went Too Far
- Skittish behavior over bumps.
- Understeer on mid-corner due to excessive front stiffness.
- Poor traction on exit from too much diff lock.

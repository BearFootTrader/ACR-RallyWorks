# Rally Setup Workflow and Terms

## Workflow
- Start from a known baseline for the surface.
- Make one change at a time in small steps.
- Run two to three repeat laps and average the feel.
- Revert quickly if the car becomes unpredictable.

## Common Terms
- Understeer: car pushes wide, needs more front grip or less rear grip.
- Oversteer: rear rotates too much, needs more rear grip or less front grip.
- Rotation: how easily the car turns mid-corner.
- Traction: ability to put power down without wheelspin.
- Compliance: ability to follow bumps without losing contact.

## Directional Changes
- Stiffer front: more understeer, sharper response.
- Stiffer rear: more oversteer, quicker rotation.
- More front toe-out: better turn-in, less stability.
- More rear toe-in: better stability, less rotation.
- More preload or ramp locking: more stability on throttle, less rotation.

## Testing Tips
- Use the same stage segment for consistency.
- Note speed and gear at corner entry, apex, and exit.
- Log changes in a simple list to track cause and effect.

# Troubleshooting - Handling Balance

## Understeer on Entry
- Reduce front ARB or front spring rate.
- Increase rear ARB or rear spring rate slightly.
- Reduce front diff coast locking or preload.
- Add a touch of front toe-out.
- Gravel: raise ride height if striking; keep alignment modest; loosen centre/front diff a notch for rotation.
- Tarmac: add a bit more negative front camber and toe-out; lower ride height slightly; tighten rear ARB a click.

## Oversteer on Entry
- Increase front ARB or front spring rate.
- Reduce rear ARB or rear spring rate slightly.
- Increase rear diff coast locking or preload.
- Add a touch of rear toe-in.
- Gravel: soften rear fast bump/rebound to keep contact; increase rear toe-in slightly; avoid very stiff rear ARB.
- Tarmac: firm front ARB/springs a click; raise rear coast locking; add a bit more rear toe-in for stability.

## Understeer on Exit
- Reduce rear diff locking or preload.
- Soften rear ARB or rear springs.
- Lower rear tyre pressures slightly.
- Gravel: keep diffs on the open side; shorten final drive; lower rear pressures a touch for traction.
- Tarmac: add rear camber or a touch more rear lock if inside wheel spins; ensure ride height is low enough for support.

## Oversteer on Exit
- Increase rear diff locking or preload.
- Stiffen rear ARB slightly or reduce front ARB.
- Increase rear toe-in.
- Gravel: soften rear dampers/ARB before adding lock; small preload increase to stop snap; keep toe-in mild.
- Tarmac: add rear lock or preload; tighten rear ARB a click; add rear toe-in for planted drive off.
